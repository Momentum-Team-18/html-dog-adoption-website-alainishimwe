        Happy Valley Shelter has been finding safe and loving homes for dogs in
        the Piedmont area since  <br> 1989. We work in cooperation with local county
        shelters and rescue organizations and specialize in <br>caring for neglected
        and abandoned dogs.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Happy Valley, our staff are trained in all aspects of animal welfare
        and can give you expert advice <br> on adoption, training, and care. We are
        proud of the work we do at Happy Valley and are grateful to <br> our community
        for their support in helping us achieve our mission.
      </p>
      <p>
        We take great care in matching each dog with the right family to ensure a
        successful adoption. We <br> believe that every dog deserves a loving home, and
        we work tirelessly to make that a reality.
